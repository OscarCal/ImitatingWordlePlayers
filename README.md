# ImitatingWordlePlayers
This project includes an analysis of Wordle games published on Twitter, the creation of models that imitate players and metrics used to evaluate them.
The bulk of the work is in the Analysis folder which contains the multiple selfcontained steps of the project eachone with a Jupyter Notebook with all the code
and graphs used in each one. The anonymized dataset can be found [here]([https://link-url-here.org](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/scarcalvetsis/wordle-games)).
